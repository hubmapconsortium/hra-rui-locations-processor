- ```json-schema```: With this option, a new json schema will be exported which can be used to validate the ```registrations.yaml``` file.

  #### Commands to interact with the softwarea

â€‹		Open a terminal and refer the commands below. (Ensure you are in ```src``` folder to execute the ```cli.js``` commands. )

```bash
$ cd src
$ ./cli.js <option> <path/to/directory>

# Example:
$ ./cli.js normalize ./data/sea-ad/      # This command will normalize the registrations.yaml file. It will search for the file in '.data/sea-ad/' folder.
$ ./cli.js json-schema ./temp/file.json  # This command will generate a new json-schema which will be used to validate against the registrations.yaml file. The new json-schema will be created in the temp folder, the file name will be file.json
$ ./cli.js --help 	# This command will show the help menu which displays the options and descriptions.
```

If everything goes well, after executing the commands, you will not see any error(s).
