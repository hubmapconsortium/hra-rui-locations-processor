# HRA - RUI  Locations Processor

The HRA - RUI Locations Processor is a basic tool for processing the RUI Locations to minimize the human efforts and reducing the errors thereby maintaining the consistency across the application.

## Steps to install the software

### Prerequisite

- [ ] Microsoft Visual Studio Code ( VS Code) - https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- [ ] Adding the YAML Extension - In the VS Code, on the vertical ribbon (Activity Bar) to the left click on Extension icon (![extensions_icon](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/hra-rui-locations-processor/assets/88348124/9c2a58f6-d292-40cf-baf4-dae371c0f015)) and search for ```yaml``` and chose the one developed by Red Hat and install. 
    ![YAML_RedHat](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/hra-rui-locations-processor/assets/88348124/9e88d2c7-b412-4f4f-9eff-6139b05d3fdf)
- [ ] Node.js v16+

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/hra-rui-locations-processor.git
$ cd hra-rui-locations-processor
```

Or check out the same with Visual Studio Code or GitHub Desktop

### 2. Setting up the software

```bash
$ npm ci
```

### 3. Interacting with the software 

The software can be interacted with a terminal. There are two options the software provides:

- ```normalize```: With this option, the  ```registrations.yaml``` file will be scanned, the missing metadata will be generated and added, and ```rui_locations.jsonld``` file will be generated.

### Commands to interact with the software

â€‹Open a terminal and refer the commands below. (Ensure you are in ```src``` folder to execute the ```cli.js``` commands. )

```bash
$ npm run hra-registration-processor <option> <path/to/directory>

# Example:
$ npm run hra-registration-processor new ./data/sea-ad/            # This command starts a new registrations digital object.
$ npm run hra-registration-processor normalize ./data/sea-ad/      # This command will normalize the registrations.yaml file. It will search for the file in '.data/sea-ad/' folder.
$ npm run hra-registration-processor json-schema ./temp/file.json  # This command will generate a new json-schema which will be used to validate against the registrations.yaml file. The new json-schema will be created in the temp folder, the file name will be file.json
$ npm run hra-registration-processor help 	# This command will show the help menu which displays the options and descriptions.
```

If everything goes well, after executing the commands, you will not see any error(s). 

## Documentation

The tool uses YAML file to generate the jsonld file containing the providers, and the RUI Locations. The examples (refer [here](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/hra-rui-locations-processor/tree/develop/examples)) provides 3 schemas. Refer the ```registrations.yaml``` file in each folder to view the schemas. 

Notice the first line of each ```registrations.yaml``` file, (``` # yaml-language-server: $schema=../../registrations.schema.json```). The YAML file will be validated against this ``` registrations.schema.json``` file. This file can be generated by choosing option as ```json-schema``` while interacting with the software.

So, on first line of every ```registrations.yaml``` file, you need to mention the path of schema file (schema.json) file.

``` # yaml-language-server: $schema=<path/to/schema.json>```

Once the schema file is set, and loaded properly into the yaml file ( Setting the first line) you can start entering the data. 

**YAML is case-sensitive and whitespace-sensitive and indentation defines the structure.**

#### Cheat notes for editing the YAML file

- The array in YAML starts with a hyphen (```-```) followed by a space.

- Press ```ctrl+space``` to get suggestions about adding any key field in the YAML file.

- If any required key is missing, it will be denoted by a small red marker for the section. Hover over it and it will tell which property is missing. 

- The value for ```rui_locations``` can be either a JSON filename containing the RUI locations or an object containing the RUI locations in YAML format defined in same file.
